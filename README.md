## Bubble Sort
#### Description:
From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort): Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent pairs and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. 
#### O(n) Performance:
| Best Case | Average Case | Worst Case |
|:---------:|:------------:|:----------:|
| O(n)      | O(n^2)       | O(n^2)     |

## Selection Sort
#### Description:
From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_Sort): The algorithm proceeds by finding the smallest (or largest, depending on sorting order) element in the unsorted sublist, exchanging (swapping) it with the leftmost unsorted element (putting it in sorted order), and moving the sublist boundaries one element to the right.
#### O(n) Performance:
| Best Case | Average Case | Worst Case |
|:---------:|:------------:|:----------:|
| O(n^2)      | O(n^2)       | O(n^2)     |
